%prime factor computation

	%read userinput (needs a second line break?)
	input = "Please input a positive number to compute its prime factors!".userinput;
	%{ in = *input.userinput; } + "echo ".iosyscall;
	
	%function to compute rest
	computeRest = {
		rest = { in = *dividend + "%" + *divisor; } + "bc".iosyscall;
		[ rest.result = "0" : 
			[ rest.err = "" : ^rest.out; ]
		]
		^ "-1";

	%add more recursiveness to get all prime factors
	computePrimeFactors = {
		rest = { dividend = *dividend; divisor = "2"; } + **computeRest;

	test = {dividend = *input;} + computePrimeFactors;
	
	%this should print all the prime factors, obviously currently its just the rest modulo 2
	{ in = "The prime factors of " + *input + " are " + *test; } + "echo".iosyscall;
